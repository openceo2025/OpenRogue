# OpenRogue

An open-source roguelike game built with Pyxel. Add your own monsters, items, and more â€” and help us expand a world full of infinite adventure.

## Project layout

```
openrogue/
    __init__.py
    app.py
main.py
```

The `openrogue` package holds the game code, and `main.py` launches a minimal window using Pyxel.

## Running locally

Install the dependencies and start the demo:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Press `Q` to quit the window.
